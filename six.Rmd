# Brown Rot Fungi

$$\\[0.15in]$$

### Fungi can be pathogens as we have discussed but they can also be incredibly helpful. Fungi are actually necessary to the natural world to maintain the balance of the nutrient and energy cycle. 

$$\\[0.15in]$$

Fungi are decomposers, so they have the ability to consume and therefore breakdown organic materials, releasing the nutrients and minerals within the organisms body to the environment. 

$$\\[0.15in]$$

One specific example is **brown rot fungi**. There are several species of fungi that are considered brown rot fungi but they all perform the same work. They decompose the cell walls of trees, specifically softwoods. 

$$\\[0.15in]$$

When this process is occurring the wood of the tree darkens and breaks down into cubical almost geometric pieces.

```

$$\\[0.15in]$$

The decomposed material from brown rot remains in the soil for decades. It composes the layer of soil called **humus** and is rich in nutrients and moisture for the next generation of organisms to grow there.

### Without fungi there would be no decomposition of organic materials and energy and nutrients would be trapped. This would make it nearly impossible for new life on Earth.
