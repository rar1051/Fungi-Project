## Boar's Head Tooth...aka 
# Hericium americanus 

$$\\[0.15in]$$

### Wild Boar's Head Tooth looks rather strange, and unlike the amanita species, however it is still considered a mushroom! 

$$\\[0.15in]$$

#### Hericium americanus is a species local to the northern United States as well as Canada, and while at first it may not seem like it, it is actually a mushroom! 

$$\\[0.15in]$$

#### This species belongs to a special group of mushrooms described as **sessile** meaning they are stalkless mushrooms! While they do not have the typical presentation of a cap and stalk, they still produce spores and function as a reproductive structure
